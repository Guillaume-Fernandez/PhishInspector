This single-file, pure python 3, no-dependencies implementation is intended
to be used as a library, but also provides a stand-alone unace utility.
As mostly pure-python implementation, it is significantly slower than
native implementations, but more robust against vulnerabilities.

This implementation supports up to version 2.0 of the ACE archive format,
including the EXE, DELTA, PIC and SOUND modes of ACE 2.0, password protected
archives and multi-volume archives.  It does not support writing to archives.
It is an implementation from scratch, based on the 1998 document titled
"Technical information of the archiver ACE v1.2" by Marcel Lemke, using
unace 2.5 and WinAce 2.69 by Marcel Lemke as reference implementations.
